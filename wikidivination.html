                Divination on DA uses Crystal Glazing! In order to start a Divination Prophecy, you will need to be in your third year and above. You should head to the Divination Tower on the second floor corridor.
                <br><br>

                You will need to unlock the trapdoor there - If you don't know the password, just ask another player in Year 3 and above! They'll be happy to help, but remember <b>Do not share the password with anyone in Years 1 and 2.</b>
                <br><br>
                Once inside, you can sit at a table with a crystal ball (beacon) in front of it. Once you've done that, you should stay still and stare deeply into it for 5 seconds. If you're lucky, you'll be given blindness and some words to unscramble! These are quite difficult, so don't worry if you struggle with it at first. If you're unlucky, and not focused enough (this includes wiggling around), then you will be given nausea. Perhaps Divination isn't for you, dear...
                <br><br>
                <center><img class="tag2" src="assets/images/divination2.png"></center><br>
                Occasionally, the word you'll be asked to unscramble will be another player's username. This player will be in their third year at least - we don't want to torment the first years! This means that there will be an effect placed on the target. These could be positive or negative, it entirely depends on the prophecy!
                <br><br>
                Please note that you will get an item in your inventory for this, it'll be a small prophecy (name tag). You can throw them away in the fire in the back of the Divination room.<br><br>
