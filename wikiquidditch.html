                <br><br><br>
                One of the many unique ways to experience the Wizarding World on Dumbledore's Army is Quidditch, with this fast-paced custom minigame you can experience what real Quidditch feels like.
                <br>
                <br>
                Just like in the real Hogwarts, we also have periodical Quidditch matches! These matches are played in the Quidditch Competition and are played about every weekend. To join your house’s team, contact the Head of House and ask them! Each house hosts its own tryouts to recruit new players for its team. Once in an official quidditch team, your coach will tell you more!
                <br><br>
                <b><u>Getting Started:</u></b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Quidditch can be played at many levels - you may just want to play in unofficial matches for fun, but there’s always the potential that someday, you may be able to represent your house team! All you will need to play is a broom, which can be bought from shops in Diagon or Hogsmeade. Then, do /quidditch to join the Quidditch world, and use /broomcloset to fetch your broom.
                <br><br>
                <b><u>Custom Games:</u></b>
                <br><br>
                On top of house cup matches and unofficial matches, there are also custom team matches! Everyone on the server can create their own custom team, and also invite people to it. This way, you and your friends may create a team and play against other custom teams. There’s not much known about custom teams yet except for the fact that you can make one, but expect more information on the custom team matches soon!
                <br><br>
                To make a custom team, you use <b>/dqt create [open/closed] [First team word] [Second team word]</b>
                <center><img src="assets/images/Quidditch2.png"></center>
                <br><br>
                The open/closed signifies the status of your team, closed means it’s an invite-only team and open means anyone can join it. The final team name is composed of the first team word and the second team word combined.

The invite command has a few subarguments: send, check, accept and reject.


The Quidditch Team GUI

To invite someone, you use /dqt invite send [player name]
<br><br>
To check the invites you have received, you use /dqt invite check
<br><br>

<br><br>

To kick a player from your team (you have to be a captain), use /dqt kick [player]
<br><br>
To get information about the team you’re in, use /dqt myteam
<br><br>
To open up a gui that shows all teams, use /dqt teams<br><br>

                <div class="updatetext"><u><b>Quidditch Refereeing:</b></u>
                    <br><br>
                    Of course, part of Quidditch is the game rules and refereeing, which we've tried to replicate as closely possible while still adhering to the original values of Minecraft. The rules we set in place are subject to change, but at the moment are as follows:
                    <br><br>
                    1. Contact is allowed, however seizing the broomstick of another player is not.<br>
2. A game of Quidditch will only end when a Seeker has caught the Snitch, however if both team captains decide mutually to end the match, it can end this way too.<br>
3. Bumphing - Beaters must not hit Bludgers towards any non-players. There is a 10 point deduction if they hit a Bludger into a non-player.<br>
4. Snitchnip - A non-Seeker may not catch the Snitch. If successful, this results in a 150 point deduction from the respective team.<br>
5. Squatting - Chasers and Keepers may not be in the area where the Quaffle spawns for an extended period of time - 3 warnings in chat, or less if it happens consistently. Penalty is 10 points. It is the Chaser/Keepers responsibility to ensure they do not block the Quaffle from spawning. The referee is not required to be lenient.<br>
6. Hoop Clogging - Chasers may not sit near their own hoops with little to no attempt at fulfilling their position's description.<br>
7. Unapproved Vacationing - Chasers and Keepers are not allowed to be outside of the pitch for longer than 10 seconds whilst in possession or control of the quaffle. The pitch is defined by the white wool surrounding the grass.<br>
8. Pocketting - Keepers are not allowed to use their boost to attempt to obtain the Quaffle when it is spawning. 10 point fine.<br>
9. Please note, attempting to exploit the rules - for example, though this is applicable to every rule, going in and out of the white line for rule 7 to "reset" the 10 second timer (it will continue) - will not be permitted.<br>
10. Blocking - deliberately putting oneself in the way of the opposing team's Seeker, with the intention of obstructing their view of the Snitch. Anybody can commit this foul *except* Seekers. This is up to the discretion of the referee. It is a player's responsibility when close to the Snitch/Seekers to ensure they do not impede their view.<br>
11. Correct robes - You must wear team coloured skins or team coloured armour to identify yourself.<br>
12. If the coaches of ALL teams agree that a referee’s call is incorrect, it can be undone or the match replayed, to a maximum of 3 matches in total re-playing a particular game, with best out of 2 imposed if 3 matches is reached. Submissions for this must be made by a coach within 24 hours of the match with supporting evidence.<br>
13. If you re-sort at all during a Quidditch season, you are not eligible to play for any team for the remainder of that season. This includes resorting and resorting back.<br>
14. All players must agree on a time for which they are available for 50 minutes after said time. For example, if two teams agree on playing a match at 7pm BST, they must be available until 7:50pm BST, otherwise a different more convenient time should be sought. Unofficial Quidditch matches can be hosted by any referee at any time, and anyone can play!<br>
15. Keepers must stay on their half of the pitch. Crossing to the other half of the pitch results in a 10 point fine.<br><br>
